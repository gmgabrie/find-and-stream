# find-and-stream

find and Stream 

## Description


This application was built in order to allow users to search and find a streaming platform for a movie.
The first  displayed movies on the screen  are  the latest trending movies as a suggestion. The user might want to choose one of them to directly and have a description just by hover the  movie card.
The user can directly type a movie title in the search area,  then the streaming options will be provided. Some features such as a light mode or a dark mode is available.
The application  uses html for structure, materialize-css and  Css for styling and Javascript for functionality.
 In the script file  we used DOM manipulation, dynamically created elements,web-APIs, third-Party-APIs, server-side APIs.
 
 We used  two different APIs:
 
    - https://rapidapi.com/movie-of-the-night-movie-of-the-night-default/api/streaming-availability
    - https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

This project has been deployed to GitHub Pages. To enjoy the functionality of  this application, you may  click on  the  link in the installation section.

## Credits

This application was built with the participation of 5 members as a team:
Dave Allen,Joshua Davey,Adam Brannon,Glenn Gabriel,Gerard Del Vecchio.
Every members did a part in this project.
It was an opportunity to apply what we have learnt so far in our coding bootcamp curriculum, and an important way to improve the team work collaboration using Github. We needed to find the best way to use new branches, to be able to build the final application in the main branch.
We also reviewed our bootcamp courses, read  from differents ressources and watched online videos, we had some good advices from our bootcamp TAs to be able to build this application.
We hope you'll enjoy this application.
From all the team members,thank you.
